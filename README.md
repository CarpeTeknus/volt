# Volt

## Introduction

Volt is an open source Azure Key Vault API compatible server (emulator) based on Node.js and written in Typescript. 

Volt is inspired by and heavily based on [Azurite](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite), an Azure Storage API emulator. Volt uses (pretty much) the same architecture and patterns that are found in the Azurite project.
